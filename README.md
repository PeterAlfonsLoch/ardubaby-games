Arduboy games that I'm writing for my son

## baby_alphabet
UP and RIGHT buttons move forward in the alphabet. LEFT and DOWN buttons move in reverse. A/B buttons play the alphabet song. 

## tractor
D-pad buttons move the tractor. Tractor makes an "engine" sound and wraps around the screen. A button goes "beep beep". B button plays "Old McDonald"
